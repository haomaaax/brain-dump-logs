# Welcome to Brain Dump Logs

This is my first post in this new blog setup. I'm using MkDocs with the Material theme and the blog plugin to create a space for my free writing.

The goal here is to have a low-friction way to capture thoughts and ideas without worrying too much about polish or structure. Just pure brain dumping.

## Why This Format?

I've tried various blogging platforms and note-taking apps, but there's something appealing about:

- Plain markdown files
- Version control with git
- Static site generation
- Full control over the setup

This feels like the right balance between simplicity and functionality for personal writing.

## What to Expect

Posts here will be:
- Unfiltered thoughts
- Work-in-progress ideas  
- Random observations
- Technical notes
- Whatever comes to mind

No promises on quality or consistency - this is intentionally a rough, experimental space.
